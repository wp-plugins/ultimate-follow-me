We were tired of confusing and bulky "follow me" plugins for wordpress so we decided to make our own. 

== Description ==

Ultimate Follow Me is a Simple yet Valuable Plugin.

Easily link to your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Youtube profiles in this widget so that your readers can find you across the web.

As an added bonus, include your RSS feed and a "Contact Me" link where users can send you email or be redirected to any page (preferably a "Contact Me" page on your site).

This plugin includes 3 different styles of icons for you to choose from.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `ultimate-follow-me.php` and the "style1", "style2", "style3" directories to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to Appearance->Widgets, drag the widget to any sidebar, and choose your options
4. Profit

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I change the settings? =

Go to Appearance->Widgets and change the settings

= I pasted in http://facebook.com/some_random_username and it doesn't work, what gives? =

Enter your facebook username (ie, facebook.com/username) or profile id (ie, facebook.com/profile.php?id=your_profile_id) and the widget will automagically figure out the rest.
